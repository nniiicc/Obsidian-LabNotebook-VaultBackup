Really enjoyed this post by Jessica Hullman https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/07/01/taking-theory-more-seriously-in-psychological-science/ 
- In particular, I liked how she decribed "probabilistic evidence and possibilistic explanations" 
		- where the latter often describe **why something might be like it is**, but have nothing to say about **how likely it is**. For example, in early stages of exploratory data analysis, one might start to generate hypotheses for why certain patterns exist, but these conjectures typically won’t encode information about prevalence, just possible mechanism. This can make colloquially-stated theory misleading, perhaps, where it describes some seemingly “intuitive” account that might be consistent with or inspired by some evidence but not representative of more common processes.
